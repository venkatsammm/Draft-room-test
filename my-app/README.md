# NFL Fantasy Draft Frontend

This is a comprehensive frontend application for testing and using the NFL Fantasy Draft backend. The frontend includes both the main draft application and backend testing capabilities.

## Features

### üèà Main Draft Application
- **Real-time Fantasy Draft**: Join or create draft rooms with real-time player selection
- **Lineup Configuration**: Supports the full fantasy football lineup format (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, K, DST)
- **Player Preferences**: Set preferred players before the draft starts
- **Turn-based Selection**: 45-second timer per pick with auto-pick functionality
- **Multi-round Draft**: 16 rounds with 9 starters + 7 bench players
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates for all players in the room

### üîß Backend Testing Panel
- **Connection Testing**: Verify backend connectivity
- **API Endpoint Testing**: Test all backend endpoints
- **Lineup Configuration**: View and test lineup settings
- **Room Management**: Create and manage draft rooms
- **Player Pool**: Test player data retrieval
- **Real-time Status**: Monitor backend health and status

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Backend server running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser

### Backend Setup

Make sure your backend server is running:

```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend should be running on `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

### Testing Backend Functionality

1. **Backend Testing Panel**: The main page includes a testing panel at the top
   - Click "Test Connection" to verify backend connectivity
   - Click "Get Lineup Config" to test lineup configuration
   - Click "Get All Rooms" to see active rooms
   - All tests show detailed results and response data

2. **API Testing**: Use the testing panel to verify:
   - Backend connection status
   - Lineup configuration retrieval
   - Room creation and management
   - Player pool data
   - Real-time socket connections

### Using the Draft Application

1. **Create or Join Room**:
   - Enter your username
   - Create a new room or join an existing one using a room ID

2. **Set Preferences**:
   - Select your preferred players in order of preference
   - Submit preferences to participate in the draft

3. **Start Draft** (Host only):
   - Host can start the draft when all players have submitted preferences
   - Minimum 2 players required to start

4. **Draft Players**:
   - Take turns selecting players from the available pool
   - 45-second timer per pick
   - Auto-pick enabled for timeouts

5. **View Results**:
   - See final teams after draft completion
   - View all players' preferences and selections

## Backend API Endpoints Tested

- `GET /` - Backend status and health check
- `GET /api/lineup-config` - Fantasy football lineup configuration
- `GET /api/players` - Player pool data
- `GET /api/rooms` - List all active rooms
- `POST /api/create-room` - Create new draft room
- `GET /api/room/:roomId` - Get specific room information

## Socket.IO Events

The frontend handles these real-time events:
- `draft-state` - Current draft state updates
- `draft-started` - Draft initialization
- `turn-update` - Turn changes and timer updates
- `player-selected` - Player selection events
- `draft-completed` - Draft completion
- `preferred-players-updated` - Preference submission confirmations

## Error Handling

The frontend includes comprehensive error handling:
- Connection failures
- API endpoint errors
- Socket.IO disconnections
- Invalid room IDs or usernames
- Draft rule violations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Connection Failed**:
   - Ensure backend is running on port 8000
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify CORS configuration

2. **Socket Connection Issues**:
   - Check WebSocket transport settings
   - Verify backend socket.io setup
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Player Pool Empty**:
   - Verify PlayerDetails.json exists in backend
   - Check backend logs for player loading errors

4. **Draft Not Starting**:
   - Ensure all players have submitted preferences
   - Check minimum player requirement (2 players)
   - Verify host permissions

### Debug Information

The frontend provides detailed logging:
- Console logs for all socket events
- API response data in testing panel
- Real-time connection status
- Error messages with context
